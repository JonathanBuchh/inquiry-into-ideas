## Imagine You're An Alien

If I were an alien, I might find Earth's reliance on the sun to be strange:

> There are other ways to use energy, yet everything on the Earth relies on the sun.
> All food chains on Earth start with the sun, so all living life is reliant on the big ball of gas in the sky.
> Humans have not figured out how to transfer energy without losing energy.
> Energy _can_ be created, yet Humans have not realized how to do it and have created "laws of nature" that state that "energy cannot be created or destroyed."
> Statements like that are limiting.
